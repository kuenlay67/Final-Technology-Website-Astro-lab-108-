    <h2>Week 1 Recap</h2>
    <p>
      In this lesson, we were introduced to three essential tools used in astronomy and data science:
      <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>NumPy</strong>, and <strong>Matplotlib</strong>. Python is a beginner‑friendly programming language widely used for scientific computing. NumPy allows us to work efficiently with numerical data arranged in arrays, making calculations much faster and easier. Matplotlib helps us create visualizations so we can interpret data through graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We practiced plotting a straight‑line graph, comparing two functions, creating a bar chart, and making a scatter plot. These foundational skills prepare us to analyze and visualize real astronomical data throughout the course.

    <h2>Assignments</h2>
    <p>Create the following graphs and upload them to your Google Drive:</p>

    <div class="code-block">
      <p><strong>1. Line Graph of y = 2x</strong></p>
      <pre>
x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
y = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
      </pre>

      <p><strong>2. Line Graph of y = x²</strong></p>
      <pre>
x = [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [25, 16, 9, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
      </pre>

      <p><strong>3. Scatter Plot</strong></p>
      <pre>
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
      </pre>

    <h2>How to Upload the file</h2>
    <p>First, you have to download the data.zip file I send you. Extract that file and move it desktop or anywhere which is easy for you to move. Then you have to create a file in google-colab and rename it "data" no extra spaces no capital mistakes. Take the extracted file from the data.zip I sent and move it in the "data" folder you created on google drive.</p>
