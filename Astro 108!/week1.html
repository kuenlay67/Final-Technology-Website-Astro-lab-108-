    <h2>Week 1 Recap</h2>
    <p>
      In this lesson, we were introduced to three essential tools used in astronomy and data science:
      <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>NumPy</strong>, and <strong>Matplotlib</strong>. Python is a beginner‑friendly programming language widely used for scientific computing. NumPy allows us to work efficiently with numerical data arranged in arrays, making calculations much faster and easier. Matplotlib helps us create visualizations so we can interpret data through graphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We practiced plotting a straight‑line graph, comparing two functions, creating a bar chart, and making a scatter plot. These foundational skills prepare us to analyze and visualize real astronomical data throughout the course.

    <h2>Assignments</h2>
    <p>Create the following graphs and upload them to your Google Drive:</p>

    <div class="code-block">
      <p><strong>1. Line Graph of y = 2x</strong></p>
      <pre>
x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
y = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
      </pre>

      <p><strong>2. Line Graph of y = x²</strong></p>
      <pre>
x = [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [25, 16, 9, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
      </pre>

      <p><strong>3. Scatter Plot</strong></p>
      <pre>
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
      </pre>

      <strong>NOTE:</strong> Complete the <em>.ipynb</em> file and upload it to Google Drive.
      You may use Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook for this assignment.
    </p>

    <h2>My Graphs -Assignments-</h2>
    <p>Below are the graphs I created for week 1 assignment, along with a brief description of each.</p>

    <div class="image-section">
      <h3>1. Line Graph of y = 2x</h3>
      <img src="y = 2X.png" alt="Line graph of y = 2x">
      <p>This is the graph I generated using Google Colab. This graph shows a straight-line relationship between x and y, where y increases by 2 for each increment of x.</p>

      <h3>2. Line Graph of y = x²</h3>
      <img src="y = x2.png" alt="Line graph of y = x²">
      <p>This is the graph I generated using Google Colab. This graph represents a quadratic function, showing how y grows faster as x moves away from 0.</p>

      <h3>3. Scatter Plot of Simple Points</h3>
      <img src="scatter plot.png" alt="Scatter plot of simple points">
      <p>This is the graph I generated using Google Colab. This scatter plot shows points along a straight line, demonstrating the relationship y = 2x for discrete points.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>My Google Colab Notebooks</h2>
    <p>Here are the notebooks I created during Week 1. Click the links below to open them in Google Colab.</p>

    <h2>Assignment Journey</h2>
    <p>Here are some screenshots I took during Week 1 along with brief descriptions.</p>

    <div class="screenshot-section">
      <div class="screenshot-item">
        <img src="group assignment screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of line graph y=2x">
        <p>This was the group called Astrolab 108 in gmail, where the instructors students gave us our assignments and notes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="screenshot-item">
        <img src="assignment.png" alt="Screenshot of quadratic graph y=x²">
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>I was working on the assignments but faced a lot of problems with errors in codes and information. Luckily I proceeded with the help of my friends.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="screenshot-item">
        <img src="software carpentry screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of scatter plot">
        <p>They made us go through this to understand python better.</p>

    <h2>How to Upload the file</h2>
    <p>First, you have to download the data.zip file I send you. Extract that file and move it desktop or anywhere which is easy for you to move. Then you have to create a file in Google Colab and rename it "data" (no extra spaces, no capital mistakes). Take the extracted file from the data.zip I sent and move it into the "data" folder you created on Google Drive.</p>
