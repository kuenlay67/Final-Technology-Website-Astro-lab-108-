        <h2>What is Astro 108?</h2>
        <p>
            Astro 108 course is an introductory astronomy course that covers the fundamental concepts of the universe, such as planets, stars, galaxies, and cosmology. These courses are often designed for students who are not science majors and teach scientific principles through a combination of lectures, labs, readings, and sometimes even computer simulations and observation exercises. The specific topics and depth can vary, with some being more conceptual and others more quantitative or research-focused.

        <h2>How is it Conducted?</h2>
        <p>
            This course is structured around weekly lessons, each exploring a different aspect of astronomy. Taught by experienced students who previously completed the introductory astronomy course, it features interactive sessions, practical activities, weekly assignments, and guided instruction to support deeper learning and engagement. Classes are typically held on Wednesdays after dinner and last for about an hour or slightly longer
